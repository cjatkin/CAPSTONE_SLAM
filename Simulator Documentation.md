# SLAM Simulator Setup

These steps are for setting up a drone simulator that creates a map using 3D LIDAR. This map is created using a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. 

Installing on Windows 10, specifically version ...

## Install Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 (WSL 1)

Enable WSL by opening “Control Panel”, “Programs”, “Turn Windows features on or off”, selecting “Windows Subsystem for Linux”, and press OK.

## Setting up the Build Environment

### Git

The first step here is to set up Git so that the ArduPilot code repositry can be retrieved then built.

`sudo apt-get update`\
`sudo apt-get install git`\
`sudo apt-get instal gitk git-gui`

### Clone the ArduPilot repository

Next step is to clone the ArduPilot code form the main repository. If a custom version of ArduPilot is being ran, the link to that repositry can be used instead.\
`https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git` Link to the github

In the command line clone the repositry to your local machine using:\
`git clone –recurse-submodules https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git`\
`cd ardupilot`

For debian based systems there is an included script that will install all of the required packages.\
`Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y`

Reload the path (log-out and log-in to make it permanent):\
`. ~/.profile`

## Install XWindow application

Xwindow applications allow for windows with UI elements to be created when running linux from the command line.\

Install VcXserver with default settings
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/\

`~/.bashrc\`

`# Export Display for XWindows`\
`# For WLS1`\
`export DISPLAY=0:0`


##Setting up SITL

`cd arudpilot/ArduCopter`\
`sim_vehicle.py -w`

##Run Mavproxy

`cd ~/ardupilot/ArduCopter`\
`../Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py --map --console`




In the terminal enter\
`Mode guided`\
`Arm throttle`\
`Takeoff 40`

## MavProxy + AirSim

In WSL\
`sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter -f airsim-copter --console --map`\

`Param set ARMING_CHECK 0`\
`Mode guided`\
`Arm throttle`\
`Takeoff 40`



## Setup RC Controller

## Get Maps that are built in Unreal Engine 4

## Install MavROS 

## Install ROS (Melodica?)

## Catkin Workspace

## rviz

## RPLidar Node

## Hector SLAM
